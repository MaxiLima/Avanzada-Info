BUBBLE SORT

Animations : https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort

ALGORITHM:

for i = 1:n,
    swapped = false
    for j = n:i+1,
        if a[j] < a[j-1],
            swap a[j,j-1]
            swapped = true
    â†’ invariant: a[1..i] in final position
    break if not swapped
end

DISCUSSION:

Bubble sort has many of the same properties as insertion sort, but has slightly higher overhead. In the case of nearly sorted data, bubble sort takes O(n) time, but requires at least 2 passes through the data (whereas insertion sort requires something more like 1 pass).

PROPERTIES:

Stable
O(1) extra space
O(n2) comparisons and swaps
Adaptive: O(n) when nearly sorted
